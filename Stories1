fiona x eli ( priestess x seer )

START 
" help me!" with no hesitation I sent owl over. My fiona is the most important! Owl is probably going to be angry at me for letting him get spanked in 
place of fiona, but anything for her. Owl returned to my shoulder, with a few feathers missing and his tail bruised. " You kidding me? It was that big spider! You 
let me get spanked by that? I hate you." Owl glared at me and refused to talk to me. Well thats the price I pay. 
I stood by the gates and waited for Fiona. Where is she? I was starting to get panicky. I was not going to leave without Fiona. 
In just three seconds, my worst fear came alive. Violetta chased Fiona all the way to the gate I was at, I dashed foward to shield her from Violetta's relentless blade attacks. 
Violetta did not seem to care about me at all she went straight foward...
" NO FIONA NO " her blade slashed across Fiona's arm, red blood slowly drenched her clothes as she hit the ground. My heart fell, I failed. I failed to protect Fiona. I knelt down 
and lifted Fiona up. " ARGH " I suddenly felt a sharp pain on my back. Violetta is not letting anyone go. Aware that I was protecting Fiona, she took adavantage to 
end me. 
I gritted my teeth and gently placed Fiona to the ground,before dropping to the ground in pain. Owl flew off my shoulders towards Violetta spanking her in the face 
till she could take it no longer and quickly left.
